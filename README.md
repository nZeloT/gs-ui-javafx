Added minor hack to have better placement of the edge label in case of a directed graph with back and forth arcs.

GraphStream
===========

The GraphStream project is java library that provides a API to model,
analyze and visualize graphs and dynamic graphs.

Check out the Website (http://www.graphstream-project.org/) for more information.

UI
--

This module provides a JavaFX implementation of the GraphStream Viewer.

This renderer supports almost all of the CSS properties defined in the [GraphStream CSS Reference](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/GraphStream-CSS-Reference_1.0/), however it is still a work in progress. This viewer is intended only at 2D visualization actually.

We are interested in any suggestion to improve this renderer, and your use cases could be of great help for us in developing this project. If you like and use this project, this could be a good contribution.

Building and jars
-----------------
The project need gs-core for compile.
The release comes with a pre-packaged jar file named gs-ui-javafx.jar that contains the GraphStream classes related to this UI. To start using GraphStream, simply put this jar file and the gs-core.jar in your class path.
